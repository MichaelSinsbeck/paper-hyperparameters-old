Research code for the paper "Exploratory-phase-free estimation of GP hyperparameters in sequential design methods - at the example of Bayesian inverse problems"

This code reproduces all of the results in the article.

The core functionality is contained in the package "bbi", which stands for "Bayesian Bayesian Inversion"

I created the two experiments with more than a year of time in between. Therefore, the two experiments use different versions of bbi. The latest version is in Experiment 2.
